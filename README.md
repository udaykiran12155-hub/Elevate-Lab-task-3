Library Management System
Welcome to the Library Management System! ðŸ“š This project is a command-line application built in Python to simulate a basic library's operations. It's designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Features
This system allows for the management of library members and books. Key features include:

Book Management: Add new books, list all available books, and mark books as borrowed or returned.

Member Management: Register new members, view a list of all registered members, and track books borrowed by each member.

Borrowing & Returning: A streamlined process to borrow a book (if available) and return it, updating the status of both the book and the member's record.
